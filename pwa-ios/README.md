# Kopi Kakis PWA - iPhone Testing Version

## Quick Setup for iPhone Testing

### Option 1: Simple HTTP Server (Fastest)
1. Open Terminal and navigate to this folder:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/yilinzhang/AndroidStudioProjects/WTH2025/pwa-ios
   ```

2. Start a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python (if available)
   python3 -m http.server 8000

   # OR using Node.js (if available)
   npx http-server -p 8000

   # OR using PHP (if available)
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. Find your Mac's IP address:
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```

4. On your iPhone, open Safari and go to:
   ```
   http://YOUR_MAC_IP:8000
   ```
   (Replace YOUR_MAC_IP with the IP from step 3)

5. **Add to Home Screen:**
   - Tap the Share button in Safari
   - Tap "Add to Home Screen"
   - The app will work like a native app!

### Option 2: Firebase Hosting (More Permanent)

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login and initialize:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase init hosting
   ```

3. Deploy:

   ```
